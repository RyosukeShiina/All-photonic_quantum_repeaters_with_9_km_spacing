%{

[Abstract]

This function outputs the simulated errors in the Z and X bases within a single segment, during (1) Construction of Elementary Entangled Bell Pairs and (2) Outer-Leaves Swapping.


[Inputs]

L0 — The distance between a repeater and its adjacent repeater, measured in kilometers [km]. Typically, we set L0 = 9.

sigGKP — The standard deviation of the Gaussian displacement noise applied to both the q and p quadratures of both qubits in the G0 states. Typically, we set sigGKP = 0.12.

etas — The efficiency of the optical switch applied to the remaining graph states after a measurement with discard windows. Typically, we set etas=0.995.

etad — The efficiency of a single homodyne detection. Typically, we set etad = 0.9975.

etac — The efficiency of a single connector between the photon fiber and the quantum chip. Typically, we set etac = 0.99.

k — The number of multiplexing levels. For example, setting k = 15 results in the generation of 15 end-to-end entangled Bell pairs.

ErrProbVec — The output of the R_LogErrAfterPost function. It contains the bit-flip error probabilities for the 10 measurement types, which are made approximately equal by tuning the window sizes.


[Output]

logErr — A (k, 2) binary matrix. Each row corresponds to the i-th high-quality optical channel. The first column indicates the presence of a bit-flip error in the Z basis, and the second column indicates the presence of a bit-flip error in the X basis.
        Specifically:
            - [0, 0] means that neither Z nor X bit-flip errors occurred.  
            - [1, 0] means that only a Z bit-flip error occurred.  
            - [0, 1] means that only an X bit-flip error occurred.  
            - [1, 1] means that both Z and X bit-flip errors occurred.

%We first create a lookup table to detect weight-1 bit-flip errors in the [[7, 1, 3]] code.
