function [Zerr,Xerr] = UW3_InnerAndOuterLeaves(L0, sigGKP, etas, etam, etad, etac, Lcavity, k, v, leaves, N)

%{

[Abstract]

This function outputs the error probabilities in the Z and X bases for a single segment.  
Specifically, it simulates the errors arising from a sequence of three processes within one segment:  
(1) Construction of Elementary Entangled Bell Pairs, (2) Outer-Leaves Swapping, and (3) Inner-Leaves Swapping.


[Inputs]

L0 — The distance between a repeater and its adjacent repeater, measured in kilometers [km]. Typically, we set L0 = 9.

sigGKP — The standard deviation of the Gaussian displacement noise applied to both the q and p quadratures of both qubits in the G0 states. Typically, we set sigGKP = 0.12.

etas — The efficiency of the optical switch applied to the remaining graph states after a measurement with discard windows. Typically, we set etas=0.995.

etam — The efficiency of mirror reflection per bounce. Typically, we set etam = 0.999995.

etad — The efficiency of a single homodyne detection. Typically, we set etad = 0.9975.

etac — The efficiency of a single connector between the photon fiber and the quantum chip. Typically, we set etac = 0.99.

Lcavity — The distance between successive bounces inside a mirror room or an optical cavity, measured in meters [m]. Typically, we set Lcavity = 2.

k — The number of multiplexing levels. For example, setting k = 15 results in the generation of 15 end-to-end entangled Bell pairs.

v — The window size of measurement type 7. This is the widest window among all types of measurements. 
    The window sizes for all other measurement types are determined relative to this, such that the bit-flip error probabilities are equal across all measurements. 
    Typically, we set v = 0.3. This choice is based on the observation that the bit-flip error probability saturates around v = 0.3.

leaves — An integer parameter that can take values 0, 1, or 2, specifying which processes to simulate.  
			- leaves = 0: Simulates only (1) Construction of Elementary Entangled Bell Pairs and (3) Outer-Leaf Swapping.
			- leaves = 1: Simulates all three processes —
				(1) Construction of Elementary Entangled Bell Pairs,  
				(2) Outer-Leaves Swapping, and  
				(3) Inner-Leaves Swapping.  
			- leaves = 2: Simulates only (1) Construction of Elementary Entangled Bell Pairs and (2) Inner-Leaf Swapping.

N — The number of trials. When N = 100, the simulation is repeated 100 times.


[Outputs]

Zerr — The bit-flip error probabilities in the Z basis. For example, setting k = 15 results in a column vector with 15 elements, ordered from the lowest to the highest value.

Xerr — The bit-flip error probabilities in the X basis. For example, setting k = 15 results in a column vector with 15 elements, ordered from the lowest to the highest value.
