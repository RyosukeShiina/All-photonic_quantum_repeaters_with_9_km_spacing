function logErr = UW2_InnerLeaves(L0, sigGKP, etas, etam, etad, etac, Lcavity, ErrProbVec)

%{

[Abstract]

This function outputs the simulated errors in the Z and X bases within a single segment, during (1) Construction of Elementary Entangled Bell Pairs and (2) Outer-Leaves Swapping.


[Inputs]

L0 — The distance between a repeater and its adjacent repeater, measured in kilometers [km]. Typically, we set L0 = 9.

sigGKP — The standard deviation of the Gaussian displacement noise applied to both the q and p quadratures of both qubits in the G0 states. Typically, we set sigGKP = 0.12.

etas — The efficiency of the optical switch applied to the remaining graph states after a measurement with discard windows. Typically, we set etas=0.995.

etam — The efficiency of mirror reflection per bounce. Typically, we set etam = 0.999995.

etad — The efficiency of a single homodyne detection. Typically, we set etad = 0.9975.

etac — The efficiency of a single connector between the photon fiber and the quantum chip. Typically, we set etac = 0.99.

Lcavity — The distance between successive bounces inside a mirror room or an optical cavity, measured in meters [m]. Typically, we set Lcavity = 2.

ErrProbVec — The output of the R_LogErrAfterPost function. It contains the bit-flip error probabilities for the 10 measurement types, which are made approximately equal by tuning the window sizes.


[Output]

logErr — A (k, 2) binary matrix. Each row corresponds to the i-th high-quality optical channel. The first column indicates the presence of a bit-flip error in the Z basis, and the second column indicates the presence of a bit-flip error in the X basis.
        Specifically:
            - [0, 0] means that neither Z nor X bit-flip errors occurred.  
            - [1, 0] means that only a Z bit-flip error occurred.  
            - [0, 1] means that only an X bit-flip error occurred.  
            - [1, 1] means that both Z and X bit-flip errors occurred.

%We first create a lookup table to detect weight-1 bit-flip errors in the [[7, 1, 3]] code.

%The binornd(n, p, A, B) function generates a (A, B) matrix of random numbers drawn from the binomial distribution with n trials and success probability p for each trial.
%Here, we set n = 1 and obtain a binary matrix, since each GKP qubit can be measured only once. We set A to the number of specified measurement types, and B to the multiplexing level k.

%We derive eta that is a total error probability during being stored in a mirror room.
%The inner-leaves must wait while the outer-leave travels a distance of L/2 and the analog information returns over the same distance.
%Since the speed of light in a photon fiber is 30% slower than in vacuum, the inner leaves must wait for t [s] = 1000*L [m] / (7/10)*c_vacuum[m/s] in a mirror room or optical cavity.
%During this period, the inner leaves bounce off the mirror t[s] * c_air[m/s] / Lcavity[m] times. (Here, we assume c_air = c_vacuum).
eta = etam^(L0*1000*10/(Lcavity*7));



%Subsequently, we apply eta derived above, along with additional errors.  
%Note that the final Elementary Entangled Bell Pairs are affected by a single optical switch and pass through four connectors from the factory to the detection center in a repeater, in addition to one more optical switch located at the detection center.
